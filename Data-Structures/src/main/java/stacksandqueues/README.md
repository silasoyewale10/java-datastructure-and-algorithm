### Stacks and Queues
Stacks is first in last out and queue is first in first out. 
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement classes called Node, Stack and Queue in java. Stack is last in first out and Queue is first in first out. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I implemented Stack and Queue with the help of the Node class. I used dry, making each method take care of particular task. The big o for most methods is either O of 1 or at worst O(n). 
For the Stack, the reference is always pointing to the top Node and for the Queue, the reference is always pointing to the front node. 

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
No API needed.
