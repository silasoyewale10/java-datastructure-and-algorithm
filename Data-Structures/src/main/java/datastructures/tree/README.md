## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored 
in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals 
called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns
an array of the values, ordered appropriately
The binarysearch tree class must have add method to add new node and contains to check if a value is in the tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
For my binarysearch tree search has a big O of log n base 2. adding is O(n).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
No API needed.
